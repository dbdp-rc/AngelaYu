                <span>World</span>

                p{
                    background-color : red;
                    display:inline-block;
                    width:100px;
                }
                span{
                    display :inline;
                    background-color : blue;
                    width : 100px ;
                }
                .sec_P{
                /*     display :none; */
                    visibility:hidden;
                /*   both hides the element */
                }
1.height of block is determined by the content inside
2.order of the element comes from the HTML
3.children sit on top of parents...childern is nearer to viewer screen compared to the parent element...z-axis
3.position property is used to change this property.....static,relative,absolute,fixed
                
                -- all html are static by default
                
                -- relative : it would position the element with respect to the position if the element was static by desired amount
                    cordinate properties : top bottom left right
                        top : 20 px , element moves down by 20px ie. margin of margin-top is given for 20px
                        right:20 px , element moves left by 20px
                        left:20 px , element moves right by 20px
                        bottom:20 px , element moves up by 20px
                    it doesn't effect the other element's position on the screen
                
                -- absolute : we position the element with relative to its parent ie. an image inside a div is given position absolute and right : 30px , it will shift the image to the right side and 30px gap from the border of the div.
                            it also effects the position of the other elements .

                --fixed: it  fixes the element position,if scrolling done it stays there
